# Work Day Scheduler

##description

Within the Work Day Scheduler website I wanted to create a site that will give the user the ability to track their day from 9am - 5pm. The user will be able to see upcoming events labeled with a green color, red meaning the current event and is about to pass, and gray for past events. The user will also be able to type into any of the event fields and save any input with the save button associated with that field.
