# Work Day Scheduler

#description
This website is going to be perfect for new or junior level level web devs who want to test their knowledge. Within this website you will be able to take a “Quick Quiz” that will be multiple choice. The user will have 60 seconds to answer all the questions before the time runs out. The user will also have a penalty if they answer the questions wrong. A score will go up for any questions they get right and will also display at the top of the quiz. At the end of the quiz the user will be able to write their username and save it to the website.

Within the Work Day Scheduler website I wanted to create a site that will give the user the ability to track their day from 9am - 5pm. The user will be able to see upcoming events labeled with a green color, red meaning the current event and is about to pass, and gray for past events. The user will also be able to type into any of the event fields and save any input with the save button associated with that field.
